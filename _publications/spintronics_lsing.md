**Abstract**: Here, we discuss possible implementations of neuromorphic computing through a crossbar array of spintronic domain-wall synapse devices and of Ising computing through coupled spintronic oscillators. In the first part of the paper, we show recent experimental data on domain-wall synapse, and then discuss through system-level simulations how the characterization of synaptic non-idealities based on this data leads to performance prediction for crossbar arrays made of these synapses. In the second part of the paper, we use device-level and system-level simulations to show how coupled spintronic oscillators can be used for Ising computing.
